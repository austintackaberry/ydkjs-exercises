    explanation: `When not in strict mode, default binding rules are valid which means \`this\` would be the global object, and the answer would be 'rocket ship'.

    explanation:
      '`person` has a key `printName` with a value of `printName` which refers to the function `printName`. When `person.printName()` is executed, the function reference that is stored in `person.printName` (`printName`) is executed within the `person` context, thus the implicit binding rules say that `this` is `person`.',

    explanation:
      'This one is a bit tricky. When `printFirstName()` is executed, the call-site actually does not have a context object because the call-site does not use the `person` context to reference the function. The default binding rule is therefore used to explain why the `this` falls back to the global object where there is a `var` with `firstName` of `"Joanna"`.',
