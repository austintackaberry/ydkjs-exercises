    explanation: `A program is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions.
                    The remembered information is called the state. Without state, a program could perform some tasks, but
                    they would be extremely limited in functionality.`,

    explanation: `Tokenizing/Lexing is the process of breaking up a string of characters into meaningful chunks called tokens.
                    Parsing is the act of taking a stream of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements which represent
                    the structure of the program. Code-Generation is the process of taking the tree and turning it into executable code.`,

                    string with an assigned meaning. It is structured as a pair consisting of a token name and optional token value.
