    explanation:
      '`==` checks for value equality with coercion allowed, and `===` checks for value equality without allowing coercion; `===` is often called "strict equality" for this reason. In the `a == b` comparison, JS notices that the types do not match, so it goes through an ordered series of steps to coerce one or both values to a different type until the types match, where then a simple value equality can be checked. The `a === b` produces false, because the coercion is not allowed, so the simple value comparison obviously fails. ',
