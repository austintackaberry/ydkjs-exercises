    correctAnswerId: 3,
    explanation: `This statement has four expressions in it:
      2 is a literal value expression; 
      b is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value; 
      b * 2 is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication; 
      a = b * 2 is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of the b * 2 expression to the variable a.`,

    correctAnswerId: 0,
    explanation: `A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks 
      to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly into a developer

    ],
    correctAnswerId: 3,
    explanation: `Statements like a = b * 2 are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can 
      directly understand. So a special utility on the computer (either an interpreter or a compiler) is used to translate the code you 
      write into commands a computer can understand.
      For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program
       is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.`,

    ],
    correctAnswerId: 0,
    explanation: `It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. 
      But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the 
      compiled code.`,

    correctAnswerId: 0,
    explanation: `Characters like = and * are called operators. They perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.
    Variables are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in, and should be declared before they are used. In programs, variables hold values to be used by the program. 
    By contrast to variables, literal values are the value itself. For example, 4 or 'cat' is a literal value. In other words, it stands alone without being stored in a variable.`,

    ],
    correctAnswerId: 2,
    explanation: `This statement is not true, because the console can display many log() messages simultaneously (unlike the alert() method, which only displays one at a time). 
    This is what makes console.log() a great tool for debugging your code, and for finding out what's going on under the hood.`,

    correctAnswerId: 3,
    explanation: `Compound Assignment examples:

        id: 3,

    ],
    correctAnswerId: 1,
    explanation: `When we use the == loose equals operator to make the comparison like "99.00" == 99.00, 
    JavaScript will convert the left-hand side "99.99" to its number equivalent 99.99. 
    The comparison then becomes 99.99 == 99.99, which is of course true.
    This is even true when the negative sign is outside of the double quotes, like so: -"99" == -99.00; . 
    However, comparing negative and positive values returns false even when using the loose equals (==).`,

    explanation: `JavaScript requires wrapping the conditional in parentheses, otherwise it returns a syntax error.

    Remember to also try running the same code with parentheses around the conditional.`,
