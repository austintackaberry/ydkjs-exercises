# YDKJS Exercises - [ydkjs-exercises.com](https://ydkjs-exercises.com)

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-10-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

Exercises built to help you test your knowledge as you read [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).

One of the top courses on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), asserts that you can trick yourself into thinking you are learning if you don't regularly test your knowledge. It is very easy to read YDKJS all the way through and think you know it all simply because you read it. These exercises are supposed to help you determine your strengths and your weaknesses.

## Current Status

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app, and uses React Router for routing and Material UI for styling. The project is in its infancy as only the basic architecture and routing has been set up.

## Short Term Vision

The immediate next steps are the following:

1.  Create multiple choice questions for each chapter of each book
2.  Add in-depth explanations for each question
3.  Add app state, such that the user knows how well they are doing and what areas they should re-read

## Long Term Vision

Longer term goals are the following:

1.  Have the questions be actual coding rather than multiple choice
2.  Curate external resources and recommend them to the user for material they need help with
3.  Add video explanations

## Setting up the project locally

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  `$ npm install`
3.  `$ npm start`

## Contributing

This project is absolutely accepting pull requests (first-timers welcome!).

As of right now, we don't have any fancy git hooks or test coverage requirements. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information and a breakdown of the code.
